# CMS
Content Management Tool
This project includes the full stack development items and other drag-drop interfaces to create a web page that helps you add text and content and required elements to create a blog.
It I have implemented it using MySql as backend and php for server-side rendering.
Using a js api, it can create a blog with abilities like font styles, paragraph spacing etc,.
All this can be managed by the admin using the user management and post management tools present in the application's dashboard.
